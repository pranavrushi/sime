      <h5>
            This product design and prototyping project was led by the senior researcher Utkarsh. 
            He has designed an Ergonomic Ground Chair to solve the problem of small scale 
            industry workers who spend most of their work hours sitting on ground without 
            any structural support to their back. 
            The problem was identified and a very innovative design of ground chair was
            developed that is economical, space efficient, mechanically stiff and most 
            importantly ergonomic. The product has been designed to support a wide
            range of user anthropometry and software as well as paper analysis has been
            properly carried out. As the name suggests, the chair can be put on the 
            ground and can be reclined as desired by the user. 
            There is a provision of adjusting the recline by using the easily operable 
            slot system on the lower frame. The product is still in it’s pre-prototyping 
            phase and will be manufactured once the COVID situation settles down.

            This project was led by Shivansh Goyal with his teammates Rumi Bharti
            and Utkarsh at the Society for Industrial Management and Engineering. 
            The project was regarding the modification of fuel stations to make 
            the operation possible with minimal touchpoints in times of pandemic.
            The calculations done in the project show that the operation will become
            cost-efficient under 3 years of the initiation. Apart from this, the team 
            also brought a very interesting solution for fulfilling the power demand of Electric Vehicle Fuel Station by using 
            renewable energy sources like wind and solar energy. The team developed the concept of a hybrid model that exploits 
            the energy from both wind and solar sources. They developed a robust Business
            for both their solutions after proper market study and customer survey.

      <h5>
            This project was led by Ishan Kashyap - a senior researcher 
            at the society. The project is regarding the recovery and 
            utilization of waste heat energy from an IC Engine equipped
             Automobile. About 60% of total energy of fuel is lost in 
             form of heat and the project aims to create an effective 
             system which can recover almost 50%-60% of that lost heat
              energy and store it in form of electrical energy in 
              batteries which can be used to power other systems such
               as AC, lights etc, this method when merged with 
               Kinetic energy recovery system can be utilized in
                Hybrid Vehicles and could increase the range of a 
                hybrid vehicle by almost 40%.

      <h5>
            A team of senior researchers at SIME, BIT Mesra are analysing the 
            vibrational aspect of tennis racket design. Rackets are subjected
            to a very high variation in impact load, angle of strike, velocity
            and more which makes it a very interesting component to analyse 
            and optimize it's design that shall be stiff, light and should
            provide an exceptional 'feel' to the player. In the picture,
            you see one of the modal shapes of a fundamental model of tennis 
            racket design. Based on the analysis, design will be further
            modified and correlation between various factors and racket behaviour will be worked upon.

            our atmosphere using various factors such as temperature distribution,
            pressure distribution, velocity analysis and density variation.
            Such analysis can help in analysing the true mass, volume an
            speed of the asteroid with which it entered the planet's atmosphere.

      </p>  
      <h5>
            Machine Learning techniques were used by a team of senior researchers
            at society to analyze the behaviour of customers calling to a call
            center based on the time duration of call. This was part of a lean
            six sigma project in which they were trying to understand the 
            underlying root cause behind the falling rating of a call center 
            (data provided by Institute of Business and Industrial Statistics
            of the University of Amsterdam). They found out a correlation of 0.7 between 
            the time duration of call and whether a customer hung up the call 
            in between or the problem was solved. The analysis suggested that 
            call duration needs to be further analyzed and employees should be
            trained to conclude the call in a certain time frame.
